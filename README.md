This application was built using Flutter and Firebase. The fronted part was designed perfectly to the use needs and In the firebase the Machine learning model was trained and integrated.

## Idea:
We are developing a mobile application called "MediBot" that makes identifying medicinal plants, edible parts, and Ayurvedic products a breeze. With just a photo or text from the packaging, it tells you everything you need to know.

## How it works:

  ## 1.Plant Identification: 
  Take a picture of a plant's leaves. MediBot identifies the plant and tells you if it has medicinal or edible parts. If it doesn't, it informs you that the plant doesn't have medical properties.

## 2.Raw Materials: 
For raw materials like ginger or cloves, snap a photo. MediBot identifies them and provides information on their uses and properties.

## 3.Crude Drugs: 
For packaged Ayurvedic products, you can either take a picture of the package or input the text from the packaging. MediBot identifies the medicinal herb inside, sharing its unique properties, smell, taste, and diagnostic steps. It also gives you details on the composition if it's not on the package.

## 4.Information Galore:
For every leaf, raw material, or drug, MediBot offers comprehensive information on edible parts, medicinal uses, and how they help with different diseases.

## 5.Interactive Chat: 
You can also ask questions, and MediBot responds like a friendly chatbot, making it easy to learn about herbs and Ayurvedic products.

## 6.Image Upload: 
If you have a photo of a plant, raw material, or Ayurvedic product, you can upload it for instant clarification.


MediBot is your ultimate guide to Ayurveda, simplifying the world of medicinal plants and Ayurvedic products in a user-friendly and interactive way, and it can even use text from packaging to identify crude drugs.
