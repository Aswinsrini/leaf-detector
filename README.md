# Leaf Detector
 
Our application, Leaf Detector, is crafted using Flutter for the front end and integrated with Firebase, where a machine-learning model is trained and seamlessly incorporated.

## Concept:
We present "MediBot," a mobile app designed to effortlessly identify medicinal plants, edible components, and Ayurvedic products.By simply providing a photo or text from the packaging, users can access comprehensive information.

## Functionality:

### 1. Plant Identification:
Capture an image of a plant's leaves, and MediBot swiftly identifies the plant, specifying if it possesses medicinal or edible parts. If not, it informs users that the plant lacks medicinal properties.

### 2. Raw Materials:
For raw materials such as ginger or cloves, users can snap a photo. MediBot recognizes these items and delivers information about their uses and properties.

### 3. Crude Drugs:
In the case of packaged Ayurvedic products, users can either photograph the package or input text from the packaging. MediBot identifies the medicinal herb contained, offering details on its unique properties, smell, taste, and diagnostic steps. Composition details are also provided if not on the package.

### 4. Information Repository:
MediBot supplies comprehensive information on edible parts, medicinal uses, and their efficacy against various diseases for every leaf, raw material, or drug.

### 5. Interactive Chat: 
Users have the option to ask questions, and MediBot responds in a friendly chatbot manner,facilitating easy learning about herbs and Ayurvedic products.

### 6. Image Upload:
For users with photos of plants, raw materials, or Ayurvedic products, Leaf Detector allows instant clarification through image uploads.

MediBot serves as your ultimate Ayurveda guide, simplifying the realm of medicinal plants and Ayurvedic products through a user-friendly and interactive platform. Additionally, it utilizes text from packaging to identify crude drugs.
